# Competetive Coding with C-CPP 

* The repository is to keep track of my progress in competetive coding and have access to the coding files and tools on multiple computers 
* The other goal of the repository is to analyse the change in coding style and see how I progress to writing better and secure code 
* Following best coding practices and using good object oriented structure with these programs is my first priority


No the repository is not for public showoff or to fill my daily contributions . 


** Creating this Repo to get better at Cpp and learn new algorithms and then write optimised and secure code **
